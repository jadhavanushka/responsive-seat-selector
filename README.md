# Responsive seat selector UI in HTML, CSS, and JS

A responsive web application for selecting seats in different sectors of a theater. This project provides a clear, user-friendly interface for users to select seats from different sections and preview their selections. View the live demo [here](https://seat-selector.vercel.app/).

### Large Screens: 
All theater sectors are displayed in a grid view, allowing for an easy overview.

### Small Screens: 
The seat map is replaced with a sector area map, which can be zoomed in by tapping each area, to show only a portion of the seats on the smallest screens.
